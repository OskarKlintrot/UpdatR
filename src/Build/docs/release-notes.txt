BREAKING CHANGE: Ignore compatibility with .NETStandard unless the package only targets .NETStandard. Too many packages "support" .NETStandard but haven't actually been tested to work with any other .NET versions than the .NET versions targeted. So even if a package can be installed on for exampel .NET 6 because the package targets .NETStandard2.0 that doesn't mean it actually works.
